popt.sh: popt(3) parameter aliasing for every command.

Usage:
Beside of .popt put a .poptcmd file into your home directory or $prefix/etc/poptcmd. Each line of the file
must contain a command alias, a whitespace and the real path for the command.
For example:
psql		/usr/bin/psql
Then the popt.sh must be symlinked somewhere in the $PATH as the name of the command alias.
In this example:
ln -s /usr/local/bin/popt.sh ~/bin/psql

Enjoy.
